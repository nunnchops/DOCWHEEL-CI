Open Source Software Documentation Continuous Improvement using Google Docs, Github and Gerrit




Technical implementation of a DevOps Continuous Improvement methodology to create collaborative software documentation. 
The following document outlines the theory behind CI for google docs with github and gerrit addition.


The rationale is the use of googledocs for collaborative document editing and creation. A project documentation artefact is collaboratively written and continuously pushed to a github repo on change, Gerrit is used to approve and track the changed documentation. The commits could be daily/nightly or by the minute, depending on change and approval cadence.  


Technology used: 


1. Google Docs: Collaborative editing of documentation. 
2. Go drive script for collection of google docs on change 
3. Github for storage of the docs versions, or as a target project for documentation generation. 


The Workflow for documents: 


Googledocs -> Gerrit -> Voted Approval -> Github -> Distribution
