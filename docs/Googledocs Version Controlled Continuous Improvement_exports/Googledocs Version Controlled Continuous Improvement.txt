Open Source Software Documentation Continuous Improvement using Google Docs, Github and Gerrit




Technical implementation of a DevOps Continuous Improvement methodology to create collaborative software documentation. 
The following document outlines the theory behind CI for google docs with github and gerrit addition.


The rationale is the use of googledocs for collaborative document editing and creation. A project documentation artefact is collaboratively written and continuously pushed to a Gerrit CI approval system, the proposed changes can be viewed in the text version of the document and approved for push to the master github repo fo, The  Gerrit is used to approve and track the changed documentation. The commits could be daily/nightly or by the minute, depending on change and approval cadence.  


Technology used: 


1. Google Docs: Collaborative editing of documentation. 
2. Go drive script for collection of google docs on change 
3. Automation for Go drive Linux CLI script
4. Gerrit for change approval and Continuous improvement structure +1 voting approval
5. Github for version controlled storage of the released docs, or as a target project for documentation generation. 


The Workflow for documents: 


Googledocs -> Gerrit -> Voted Approval -> Github -> Distribution
